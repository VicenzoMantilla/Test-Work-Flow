const express = require ('express')
const app= express()
const cors = require ('cors')
app.use(cors())
app.use(express.json())
app.use(express.static('public'))
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000
app.listen(PORT)

## RESOLUTION - WEEK 09

### Description

This week we were introduce to the libraries Mongoose and the database MongoDB, throughout the week

we became familiar with Mongo-Atlas & Postman.

## Introduction

For this week (09) we need to rearrange the files for the last week, we include new concepts to simplify

the tasks previously assingned.

We added new files like:

- Controllers

- Models

- Routes

For models:

- We add the schemas so that the database has a basic structure for the data to be included.

For controllers:

- Inside this folder we added the functionality for the actions we needed to do on the database.

For routes:

- Here we configure the routes that include the methods and controllers to be used.

## RUN 

First you need to run server we can do this with:
```
npm run start
```
Then you can either access to the routes with Postman or on your local web browser with the port 5000

e.g. router.use("/", nameRoute);
